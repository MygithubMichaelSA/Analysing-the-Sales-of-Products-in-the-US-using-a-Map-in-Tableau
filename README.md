# Analysing the Sales of Products in the US using a Map in Tableau

Measuring the number of products sold in the United States of America.
The categorical fields that were included in my analysis were; Quantity (no. of each product sold), profit (the amount of money made from each product) and the Category of products that were being sold.
The analysis was focused between the years, 2014 to 2017.
The map shown below focused on the comparison of the number of sales of each product and the state (as well as the country and city) each transaction took place in.
